export const REFUND_NOTE = `# Refund handling for online orders

## Before you start
- Confirm the order is within the 30-day return window (see doc:policy/refunds-v4).
- Confirm the payment was captured, not just authorised, in Stripe.

## Tools
- Stripe
- Zendesk
- OrderDB

## Steps
1. Look up the order in OrderDB by order number and verify the customer email matches the ticket.
2. Check the return reason against the accepted reasons list in doc:policy/refunds-v4.
   If reason is fraud, escalate to the risk team and stop.
3. Confirm the item was received back in the warehouse, expected: warehouse scan present in OrderDB.
4. Issue the refund in Stripe for the captured amount.
5. Reply to the customer in Zendesk with the refund confirmation number, so that the ticket can be closed. See ticket FIN-2210 for the reply template.

## Never
- Never refund to a different card than the one charged.
- Do not issue store credit instead of a refund unless the customer asks for it in writing.

## Done when
- Refund appears as succeeded in Stripe and the Zendesk ticket is solved.

2. Add the account to the engineering group in Okta so that GitHub and Jira SSO work.

   - If the role is contractor, invite as an outside collaborator on the named repositories only.
4. Add the person to the #eng-announcements and team channels in Slack.
5. Create the onboarding epic in Jira from template ONB-100 and assign it to the new hire.
6. Send the welcome message in Slack with the links from doc:onboarding/week-one.

## Rules
- If the start date is more than 7 days away, stop and schedule the checklist for the start date.

export const INCIDENT_NOTE = `# Incident triage for production alerts

## Preconditions
- The alert came from the production PagerDuty service, see https://status.example.com/runbooks/triage.
- You are the on-call engineer listed in PagerDuty.

## Tools
- PagerDuty
- Grafana
- Slack
- Jira

## Procedure
1. Acknowledge the alert in PagerDuty within 5 minutes.
2. Open the service dashboard in Grafana and check error rate and latency for the last 30 minutes.
3. If error rate exceeds 5 percent, declare a SEV1 in Slack and page the service owner.
4. If error rate is under 5 percent, post a status update in the #incidents Slack channel.
5. Create the incident ticket in Jira from template INC-77 with the alert link and the dashboard screenshot.
6. Mitigate using the runbook in doc:runbooks/service-triage, expected: error rate back under 1 percent.
7. Resolve the PagerDuty alert and link the Jira ticket in the resolution note.

## Never
- Never restart the database cluster without the service owner on the call.
- Do not close the alert before the Jira ticket exists.

## Done when
- The alert is resolved in PagerDuty and the Jira ticket links the timeline.
